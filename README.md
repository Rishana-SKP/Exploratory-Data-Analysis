# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the preliminary approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often employing visual methods. It's a crucial step that allows analysts to uncover insights, detect patterns, and identify anomalies within the data before performing more complex analyses or modeling.

#### Objectives of EDA:
Understand the Data: Explore the basic properties of the dataset, such as its size, shape, types of variables, and their distributions.

Identify Patterns and Relationships: Use visualizations and statistical summaries to discover patterns, trends, correlations, and dependencies among variables.

Detect Anomalies or Outliers: Identify unusual data points or potential errors that may need further investigation or cleaning.

Formulate Hypotheses: Generate initial hypotheses or ideas for more focused analyses based on observed patterns or relationships in the data.



#### Techniques Used in EDA:
Summary Statistics: Descriptive statistics like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.

Data Visualization: Graphical representations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc.) to visualize distributions, relationships, and trends.

Correlation Analysis: Assessing relationships between variables to understand dependencies.

Handling Missing Values: Exploring and addressing missing or null values in the dataset.

Outlier Detection: Identifying and understanding outliers that might skew analysis results.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve analysis or modeling.




#### Importance of EDA:
Data Quality Check: Helps identify data issues early in the analysis process.

Insight Generation: Provides a preliminary understanding of the data and generates hypotheses for further investigation.

Decision-making Support: Assists in determining suitable modeling techniques or additional data preprocessing steps.


EDA serves as the foundation for more advanced analytics, aiding in better-informed decision-making and deeper insights into the underlying structure of the data.
